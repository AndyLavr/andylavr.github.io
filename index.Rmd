**Introduction**

By default, Ubuntu systems run with the Ubuntu kernels provided by the Ubuntu repositories. However it is handy to be able to test with modified upstream kernels to help locate problems in the Ubuntu kernel patches, or to confirm that upstream has fixed a specific issue. To this end i now offer select upstream kernel builds. These kernels are made from modified kernel source but using the Ubuntu kernel configuration files. These are then packaged as Ubuntu .deb files for simple installation.

These kernels are not supported and are not appropriate for production use.

WIP Patched Kernel kernel distribution with custom settings:

 - Experience a whole new way to interact with your PC like never before. 
 - Full kernel adaptation to version **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Bionic.**
 - Full kernel adaptation to build GCC8.
 - Optimized to take full advantage of high-performance.
 - Supports all recent 64-bit versions of Debian and Ubuntu-based systems. 


**Main Features:**

 - Tuned CPU for Intel i5/i7/Atom platform.
 - PDS CPU Scheduler & Multi-Queue I/O Block Layer w/ BFQ-MQ for smoothness and responsiveness.
 - Caching, Virtual Memory Manager and CPU Governor Improvements.
 - General-purpose Multitasking Kernel.
 - Built on the latest GCC 8
 - DRM Optimized Performance.
 - Intel CPUFreq (P-State passive mode).
 - ZFS, BFQ and Ureadahead support available.

[![**LKRG - Linux Kernel Runtime Guard**](images/logo_openwall.png)](http://www.openwall.com/lkrg/)

## Add Linux Kernel Runtime Guard ([LKRG](http://www.openwall.com/lkrg/))

 Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG) is a loadable kernel module that
performs runtime integrity checking of the Linux kernel and detection of
security vulnerability exploits against the kernel.

## Kernel tested by - [Linux Test Project](http://linux-test-project.github.io/)

 **Linux Test Project** is a joint project started by SGI, developed and maintained by IBM, Cisco, Fujitsu, SUSE, Red Hat and others, that has a goal to deliver test suites to the open source community that validate the reliability, robustness, and stability of Linux. The LTP testsuite contains a collection of tools for testing the Linux kernel and related features.
