**Intel – Fix MMC/GPT warning**

```yama

 I had been getting a warning on boot with recent kernels on my 
Intel based UP system, and found a workaround.
The error flagged is – apparently – harmless, and is due to systemd
not being able to recognise some mmc disk partitions at that stage of the boot process.

......
[ 5.124250] systemd-gpt-auto-generator[416]: Failed to dissect: Input/output error
......

The workaround is to add systemd.gpt_auto=0 to the kernel command line.

```
