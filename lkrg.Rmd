title: "Using Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG)"
---

 - Installation of [**LKRG**](http://openwall.info/wiki/p_lkrg/Protected_Features) is exactly the same as loading normal kernel module. 
 - As soon as system is installed it starts the work. 
 - If default logging level is used, LKRG produces one short sentence saying that system is clean unless corruptions are detected.

```bash
# modprobe lkrg

# modinfo lkrg

 Add file /etc/modprobe.d/lkrg.conf

and insert string options:

options lkrg p_init_log_level=3
```

 - The project has built in a **sysctl** interface which enables the interaction between the administrator and LKRG. 
 
 **By default 5 different options are available:**

```bash
 # sysctl -a | egrep lkrg
 
lkrg.block_modules = 0
lkrg.clean_message = 0
lkrg.force_run = 0
lkrg.hide = 0
lkrg.log_level = 3
lkrg.random_events = 1
lkrg.timestamp = 15
```

 - Blocking module functionality (lkrg.block_modules) - only two options are
    available:
        0 - do NOT lock the kernel and allow to load kernel module
        1 - lock the kernel and do NOT allow to load kernel module

 - Printing "System is clean!" message (lkrg.clean_message) - only two options
    are available:
        0 - do NOT print "System is clean!" message regardless of log_level
            value
        1 - if log_level value allows it, print "System is clean!" message

 - Force (lkrg.force_run) - forces LKRG to run integrity function right now.
    It is always visible as 0 number. Nevertheless, if you set it to 1, the
    integrity checking function will be immediately fired and value restored to
    0 again

 - log level (lkrg.log_level) - it might be a number between 0-4 or 0-6 (if
    debugging compilation was used). A strong debug provides very useful data
    to identify where could be a specific problem with LKRG (if it ever
    appears). Unfortunately, it produces tons of logs per execution and must be
    used only for debugging purpose, not as a normal run.
    
 - Random events (lkrg.random_events) - only two options are available:
    0 - do NOT perform integrity checking on the random events (perform it
        only at regular intervals configured by lkrg.timestamp)
    1 - perform integrity checking on the random events (as well as at the
        regular intervals)

 - timestamp (lkrg.timestamp) - changes how often kernel timer will be
    launched (kernel timer periodically calls integrity function). It can't be
    less than 5 seconds (not to eat too much system resources) and not more
    than 1800 seconds (half an hour) - not to be silent for too long
